# Apple-Store-and-Google-Play-Store
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project I have on the website app.dataquest.iothis is the first project I had done in analysing data.

The purpose of the project is to find the most suitable type of app to implant in two different systems, Android (Google Play Store) and iOS (Apple Store).

Note: The code I do on the website (which provides a detailed guided) is different from the code I put it here, when I download the Jupyter Notebook, somehow the code I do on the website not running on my computer. So I need to redo some part of the project on my own.
